## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Rules

1. Test Coverage:
   - Before attempting completion, always make sure that any code changes have test coverage
   - Ensure all tests pass before submitting changes
   - Add test coverage for experimental features
   - Include integration tests for mode-specific functionality

2. Lint Rules:
   - Never disable any lint rules without explicit user approval
   - If a lint rule needs to be disabled, ask the user first and explain why
   - Prefer fixing the underlying issue over disabling the lint rule
   - Document any approved lint rule disabling with a comment explaining the reason
