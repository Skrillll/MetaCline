# MetaCline Migration Guide

## Quick Reference

- Status: Migration Planning
- Current Phase: 0
- Next Action: Environment Setup
- Critical Path: [P0] Tasks

## Task Tracking System

- [P0] = Critical Path (Must be done first)
- [P1] = High Priority (Blocking other tasks)
- [P2] = Medium Priority (Important but not blocking)
- [P3] = Low Priority (Nice to have)
- ‚úì = Completed
- üöß = In Progress
- ‚ùå = Blocked
